1. Remember to always check for deadlocks. This includes any three of the adjacent blocks being obstacles and any two of them that share a common vertex being obstacles. 

2. Measure the closest distance of the robot to any box so that the robot always move towards boxes instead of away from them. 

3. Check if an obstacle is between any given box and the closest allowed storage. If so, raise count by two.

4. Moving towards the closest allowed storage is not always optimal; sometimes the only path from a box to its allowed storage is to make a detour, which I have not yet found a way to implement.

5. Ideally the “innermost” storage point should be taken care of first. Otherwise a solution might not exist once that storage point is no longer accessible by its allowed boxes.
